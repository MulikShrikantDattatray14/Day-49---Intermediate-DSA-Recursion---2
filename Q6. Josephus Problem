Q4. Josephus Problem

Problem Description
Given the total number of person A and a number B which indicates that B-1 persons are skipped and the Bth person is killed in a circle. Find the last person standing in the circle.


Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 10 power 4
2 <= B <= A



Input Format
First argument A is an integer.
Second argument B is an integer.


Output Format
Return an integer.


Example Input
Input 1:
A = 4
B = 2
Input 2:
A = 5
B = 3


Example Output
Output 1:
1
Output 2:
4


Example Explanation
For Input 1:
Firstly, the person at position 2 is killed, then the person at position 4 is killed,
then the person at position 3 is killed. So the person at position 1 survives. 
For Input 2:
Firstly, the person at position 3, then the person at position 1 is killed, 
then the person at position 5 is killed. Finally, the person at position 2 is killed. 
So the person at position 4 survives. 


CODE:

module.exports = {
    //param A : integer
    //param B : integer
    //return an integer
    solve: function (A, B) {

        if (A == 1) // if there is only one person remaining at the end, return that person.
            return 1;
        else

            return (this.solve(A - 1, B) + B - 1) % A + 1;// // adding B-1 because we are skipping B-1
        //people in between and killing the next person by adding one

    }
};
